Implementation Doc

AI integration:
 ChatGPT functionality was made in the GPT.java class. This class connects to ChatGPT using a API key and the URL. This will connect to the overall system where the user can ask ChatGPT to make flash cards out of their notes. Pair programming was used where one person reviewed the code and suggested fixes as it was being written.

File Upload Functionality:
 File uploaded functionality was added in App.tsx and it allows you to be able to uplaod a file. This functionaility was acheived with pair programming.

UI Design:
 The UI needed to be updated because it was hard to read the text on top of the maroon box, so updates were added to make it more accessible and easier to read.

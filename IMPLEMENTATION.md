Implementation Doc

AI integration:
 ChatGPT functionality was made in the GPT.java class. This class connects to ChatGPT using a API key and the URL. This will connect to the overall system where the user can ask ChatGPT to make flash cards out of their notes. Pair programming was used where one person reviewed the code and suggested fixes as it was being written.
